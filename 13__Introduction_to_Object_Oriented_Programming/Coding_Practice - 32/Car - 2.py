# Car class should have the following attributes & methods
#
# Old Attributes:
#   color, max_speed, acceleration, tyre_friction
# New Attributes:
#   is_engine_started
#
# Methods:
#   start_engine: When this method is called, should set the value of attribute is_engine_started to True
# which indicates that the car engine is turned on
#
#   stop_engine: When this method is called, should set the value of attribute is_engine_started to False
# which indicates that car engine is turned off
#
# When a new car is created, the engine should be off by default


# Implement the Car class appropriately
