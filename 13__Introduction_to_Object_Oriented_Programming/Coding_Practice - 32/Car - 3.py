# Car class should have the following attributes & methods
#
# Old Attributes:
#   color, max_speed, acceleration, tyre_friction, is_engine_started
# New Attributes:
#   current_speed
#
# Old Methods:
#   start_engine, stop_engine
#
# New Methods
#   accelerate:
#       - When this method is called when the car engine is off,
#       the current_speed of the car should not increase
#       - When this method is called when the car engine is on,
#       the current_speed of the car should increase according its acceleration value
#       - Print the message "Car has not started yet" if the car engine is off
#       - Any car cannot accelerate more than its max_speed
#
# When a new car is created, the engine should be off by default and current_speed should be 0
