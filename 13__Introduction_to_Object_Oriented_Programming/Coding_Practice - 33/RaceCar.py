# RaceCar class should have the following attributes & methods
#
# Old Attributes:
#   color, max_speed, acceleration, tyre_friction, is_engine_started, current_speed
# New Attributes:
#     nitro
#
# Old Methods:
#   start_engine, stop_engine, accelerate, apply_brakes, sound_horn
#
# Override Methods:
#   sound_horn:
#       - Print "Peep Peep\nBeep Beep" if race_car engine is on
#       - Print "Car has not started yet" if race_car engine is off
#   accelerate:
#       - When car accelerates when nitro points are available
#       the current_speed will add 20 within max limits.
#       - And nitro get reduced by 1 point
#
# When a new RaceCar is created, the engine should be off by default and current_speed should be 0


# Implement the Car and RaceCar class appropriately
# Inherit the Car class into RaceCar class and override the methods which have extra features
